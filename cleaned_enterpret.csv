This is because this is the technical name of the field coming from Zendesk

Re: the other thing, I’m confused, because the field name isn’t matching what the Quantify is about `CLM - Category` is showing as the field, but the Quantify is about `Clickwrap Category`, how did that happen?
And the data is different from when I pulled the Nov data in December. I know that there are usually a few tickets that get updated, but when I pull the exact same things I pulled last month, with the same exact filters, I get wildly different results.
For example, I pulled `CLM Top 5 Categories` with Case Reason = Technical Issues for Nov 1-30. Last month’s was screenshot #1, when I pull the same today, I get screenshot #2. And if I change the field from `Success - Category` to `CLM - Category`, it’s even more off (screenshot #3).
Happy to set up a call to go over these if we need to.

Is it possible to get Enterpret data ingested into SnowFlake? Here is some context on our requirement:
• We've been using Enterpret to investigate some complex bugs where we can only rely on CS tickets to quantify the issue. 
• There are many tricky cases where we are missing the user ID on zen desk, so we only have the customer's email to work with. 
• In that case, we copy the email from the ticket data on Enterpret and look it up on SF to get the User IDs. 
Let me know if there is a better way, open to any suggestions. Thank you:)

User: Do we ask for CSAT multiple times within a ticket’s lifecycle? I thought we only ask it when the ticket is closed.

User: nope, we only ask for the CSAT 24 hours after the ticket is solved (for email). twitter tickets will receive the CSAT every time the ticket is solved but we can adjust as needed

User: Nice! Is what enterpret calls “sentiment” different from CSAT? I thought they were the same 

User: i was looking at the customer sentiment throughout the entire ticket, not their CSAT survey. the thought behind this one is that we'd be able to find tickets tickets where the support team turned the customer's interaction around

User: Right. So what Enterpret calls “sentiment” is different from CSAT?

User: Jack Divita please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey

Agent: &gt; please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey
This is exactly correct

User: thanks Jack Divita! do you know if it would also be possible to track the sentiment change within an interaction?

Agent: currently not possible, but this is not the first time we have heard this request. Have raised it with the engineering team and there will be exploration on the feasibility in the coming weeks

User: thanks! if this gets added to the roadmap, can you let us know? this could be a useful metric for us

Agent: definitely!
Before being added to the roadmap we will likely have some follow up questions on use cases and specific examples. Any additional details/thoughts you can share on those would also be helpful

User: of course, no problem
• positive -&gt; negative:
 ◦ does this lead to churn?
 ◦ are there policies that are causing this change ?
 ◦ these can also be used to identify coaching opportunities
• negative -&gt; positive: 
 ◦ identify tickets where an agent did an good job. can be used to improve training or feedback for the agents

Agent: &gt; • does this lead to churn?
This one is doable today without analyzing intra-ticket sentiment changes, we just need a little more data from Notion

Agent: Meaning - if you tell me which of your users churned (and when) I can tell you what problems they had before churning and how those compared vs users who have not churned
This is a VERY common use case today

User: In order to tell you which users have churned (and when), we'd probably have to pull subscription changes in from Stripe, which is managed by my team. Jack Divita, do you have any additional information about how/what you'd need from us to get churn data into Enterpret? I can ask my engineers if they have time for it.

Agent: The only thing I _need_ is something to join it agains the feedback record. For Zendesk it looks like we have user email, unique user ID, workspace ID, external user ID. For Gong we have workspace ID, user ID, and Email. For forethought, all I have is a record ID
I would also recommend including other additional metadata that might be useful for analysis: sign up date, churn date, churned ARR, number of seats churned, etc.

Will add the gong call in the replys:
thanks for your understanding on the call — looking forward to staying in touch.
Here’s some of our team’s verbatims from the trial:
&gt; Here’s my early thoughts + questions on Enterpret as I’m going through:
&gt; • So it pulls and creates summaries from our customer feedback channels based on keywords we specifically tag? Or can it tag automatically based on the nature of customer feedback. e.g. if we’re not tracking “agency” or “billable hours”, it can still search + create a summary based on that? Pretty powerful if so. EDIT: It can, that’s awesome! This feature alone will solidify &amp; finalise my agency positioning work :raised_hands<IP>skin-tone-5:
&gt; • I love that the feedback summary can be created based on feedback from a specific time period. Last 3 months is the perfect preset for what I’m working on.
&gt; • The sentiment analysis is brilliant too - being able to see + filter based on this is very helpful for answering questions about why people did or didn’t switch to Float / how we’re currently serving a particular group.
&gt; • Email subscription is a great win too, as it’ll help centralise insights in a given period in one place; so I can share them internally
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Curious to learn about its analytics and reporting capabilities + how confident do we feel we can trust the data and summaries it provides us. Especially if we’re going to be making key big product x marketing bets from this.
&gt; • Quantify = Sum of MRR x feedback reason = This is gold! Showing the MRR impact/churn from each feedback reason is powerful; enables us to build better features x marketing that serves our best fit customers.
&gt; • Segmentation is a key component here though, would like to see how far we can drill into each reason and split it by market, segment, use case, MRR etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I think it’s better than what we have for sure, based on it’s centralised customer feedback analysis features. Unsure how much it costs, but I imagine it’s a low-to-mid 5-figure ACV product, based on the functionality on show here.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions to ask here to move forward from my perspective:
&gt; • Does it require someone to manually feed the model every week to continue getting good results. e.g. building the taxonomy and merging reasons into perpetuity etc seems like a time-consuming job for a poor soul :sweat_smile:
&gt; • How can we use it to help inform our product x PMM OKRs, like Figma did at company level?
&gt; • For queries that are hyper-specific and new: e.g. time-zones etc, the data &amp; summaries it provides will certainly be more surface-level compared to items around billing, allocations, other core product features
&gt; • Can this be replicated with a CustomGPT from Open AI? Could we feed it all our data and have it spit out what we need?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that, I think it’s very powerful - we just need to set it up right.
&gt; The Summary inevitably end-up me wanting to know more.
&gt; 
&gt; Example:
&gt; • Issue with adding Project Dates
&gt; The summary returned:
&gt; The feedback on Float indicates that users are experiencing difficulties when trying to add start and end dates to their projects.
&gt; • *Confusion Over Adding Project Dates*: Users have reported an *Issue With Adding Project Dates*
&gt; ◦ They are unsure about how to find and set the start and end dates for their projects
&gt; ◦ This confusion is prevalent among users, leading to difficulties in project management.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Which, is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve.
&gt; But, I was also a little surprised to see only *2 FeedBack Records (over 12mth period)* :thinking_face:
&gt; 
&gt; I do like that it pulls in Community Slack records - would this act as a permanent store for this data? (that alone could be worth the cost)
&gt; 
&gt; Over in Quantify:
&gt; I tried filtering on Keywords like ‘Google calendar’ and ‘API’ - all <<STRICT_LINK> saw was a lot of support conversations>, which are not particularly useful to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m still left wondering if our numbers are too small to be meaningful, I’m concerned the ‘Summary’ statements are confidently expressed based on 1 or 2 pieces of feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, not really sure how this ties into a Feature Request system. There’s something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere, ideally with some Product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers. If this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe that’s a good thing but it’s going to be hard to grasp what a ‘request’ is.
&gt; I’m impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into. If we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be that’s very powerful and a huge timesaver right there.
&gt; 
&gt; My main concerns are:
&gt; • Confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything
&gt; • Confidence that the AI is interpreting feedback as we would. I found that when I put a csv of user feedback through ChatGPT (for rates) and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would. It was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app, industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource, planning, calendar.. they can all be applied in very different contexts.
&gt; • LOE to keep it well fed with data and context. Who owns this?
&gt; • How it connects to feature requests.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the last point, connecting to feature requests, could we import our feature requests list from Linear and then have the AI link any relevant feedback to each request in Enterpret? Then we could pull up a feature request in Enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it. If we can then dismiss inaccurate links, presumably the model can improve at making good connections?
&gt; 
&gt; Would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in Linear, Enterpret auto-links all relevant user feedback to the request (in Enterpret), then it’s all their ready when we evaluate the request.
&gt; Looks pretty slick! I was looking for feedback related to Placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful.
&gt; • It’s great you can open Intercom &amp; Gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available
&gt; • It did seem like we need to do some gardening/add some data sources but I’m very impressed seeing this v1 experience
&gt; • The ability to search and filter by sentiment, customer/company attributes (like MRR), is huuuuuuge :raised_hands:
&gt; • Importing everything seems to create some noise (e.g. I don’t need to see all the feedback about payment declines) but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves
&gt; ◦ It looks like it’s importing Intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with CS to help here

His journey as a Insight Consumer (PM) starts usually at Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this he checks if the summary is relevant from his tribal knowledge, in many cases it is sparse insights that he is able to derive from this. Like <<STRICT_LINK>> he is sure that Issue with _*Ability To Export Data*_ and _*Need for Ground Control Points Assistance: Users are seeking Help With Ground Control Points 19*_ are not applicable in context of the Keyword here - Google Earth.
All in all he is very happy with the Summaries direction as it is efficient for him to read multiple summaries, and extract meaningful insights from that as opposed to rabbit holing in Quantify land. One nit that he had though was that feedback generally starts from X records, but quotes show a very lesser number of feedback records Y, as part of summary (where Y<<<<X). His expectation was that it'd be aggregate validated. (X/X)
His general user journey is Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this, he nuances this as part of a Coda doc wherein he adds EG1, EG2, EG3 (examples of Summary quotes, or favorited Feedback records) in a doc and finalizes a breakdown doc, which can then be used by PMs/URs/Designers in his areas to pick up Discovery for. (SS attached)
For Taxonomy -
• Keywords are very useful, but there is a lot of keywords that are redundant or unusable due to being very broad in nature. There is no capability to hierarchically manage these.
• He was pretty gung-ho about Reasons initially, but found them to be too broad in many cases, even if granular reasons are present, they are not top of mind due to the attribution of records towards broader reasons being really up the pecking order.
• He had heard from the team on 'parent-child' relation of keywords and reasons as part of T3, wasn't sold on the idea, but when I took him through the broad idea of customisable nodes, which can have <<STRICT_LINK> to many relationship> , he mentioned he was excited about the direction as this might reduce the noise a lot.
• He would want this relationship to be auto-generated as Admin'ing the Taxonomy(clean-up, merges, creations) is something he hates as a PM and would ideally need AI to fill that gap.
• He commented that currently reasons and keywords operate in a standalone manner, but should be more contextual and mappable (again not by humans, but by AI)
• He also mentioned that each feedback record, shows a lot of incorrect predictions for Categories, even when he starts from a completely different keywords in place and this is misleading and erodes his trust on the tool. (SS attached)
I also updated him on Oracle and he was super excited for this, as , paraphrasing - ""For me to uncover insights by querying in natural language and see just not text, but list of Feedback records, visualizations, summaries in a single chat like interface is the direction which seems the most intuitive to me. Post having the relationships as part of Taxonomy improvements, I'm assuming the models would have a lot more context about Keywords, Reasons and their own relationships""

Example: You are editing a reason and trying to decide if you should break out a definition into its own reason. Sometimes it's pretty obvious from the definition name, but, here, `issue with defective sheets` seems like a boundary call. Being able to see which records (of 1,907 total) are being included under this reason on account of that definition would help you decide.

Agent: I have struggled with this as well
For example, Apollo wanted us to stop predicting certain reasons on records that were determined by an automated/pre-select option, but it wasnt clear from the definitions why that particular reason was applied to the record or which one we should remove to fix it

For now, I’ve added the “top reasons” to the dashboard, but the text version is much nicer to read (imo).
There isn’t a way to pin a summary to a Dashboard today, but this is exactly how we’re thinking about the near future! Super-glad that you’re finding summaries helpful, and would want to add them to Dashboards. We’re actively scoping this out.
&gt; When I try to “and” together two keyword searches I’m seeing results that only come from one term. I’ve anded together “annotation” and “dev mode” as two tracked keywords, but the results in the screenshot dont’ mention “annotations” at all. Am I misunderstanding how to setup the logic here? (BTW this “and” isn’t what I ultimately want, just noticed the funky behaviour)
The summary in the shared screenshot (image attached) and Search seems to talk about both dev-mode and annotations Molly, are you referring to the feedback cited from Discourse in this case?

This is very helpful, thank you for sharing Molly! Here’s a <<STRICT_LINK> loom> on another avenue to share feedback on summaries from within the product.
Training the AI based on shared feedback on summaries is not automated today, but we pay close attention to shared points for improvements to the model. Looking forward to your feedback!
